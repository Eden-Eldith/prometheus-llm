# Stage 1 Setup: Initial Architecture and Training Pipeline

## Basic Information
- **Date:** May 26, 2025
- **Researcher:** Team Prometheus
- **Experiment ID:** 2025-05-26-01
- **Focus Area:** Architecture & Training Infrastructure

## Objective
Establish the foundational architecture and training pipeline for Prometheus LLM, focusing on creating a stable base for future recursive dignity implementations.

## Hypothesis
A carefully configured transformer architecture with specific adaptations for recursive dignity concepts will provide a suitable foundation for training a language model capable of demonstrating emergent cognitive properties.

## Methodology
### Setup
- Model Configuration:
  ```python
  config = {
      "vocab_size": 50257,
      "d_model": 768,
      "n_layer": 12,
      "n_head": 12,
      "d_ff": 3072,
      "dropout": 0.1,
      "attention_dropout": 0.1
  }
  ```
- Training Parameters:
  ```python
  training_params = {
      "batch_size": 32,
      "max_seq_length": 512,
      "learning_rate": 6.25e-5,
      "warmup_steps": 2000,
      "max_steps": 100000,
      "gradient_accumulation_steps": 1,
      "weight_decay": 0.01
  }
  ```

### Process
1. Implemented core transformer architecture with:
   - Multi-head attention mechanism
   - Position-wise feed-forward networks
   - Layer normalization
   - Residual connections

2. Developed training infrastructure:
   - Custom dataset handling
   - Dynamic masking system
   - Gradient accumulation
   - Checkpoint management
   - Comprehensive logging

3. Created documentation structure:
   - Development log
   - Research notes template
   - Directory organization for experiments

### Metrics
Planned measurements:
- Training loss
- Perplexity
- Attention pattern analysis
- Generation quality metrics
- Memory and computational efficiency

## Results
### Initial Setup Verification

### Technical Validation
- Model parameter count: ~125M (similar to early GPT models)
- Memory footprint analysis pending
- Initial compilation and forward pass successful

## Analysis
### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Transformer Base**
   - Standard transformer architecture as foundation
   - Modifications for recursive dignity integration points
   - Scalable design for future enhancements

2. **Training Pipeline**
   - Gradient accumulation for memory efficiency
   - Dynamic batch sizing capability
   - Comprehensive logging for research analysis

3. **Documentation Structure**
   - Systematic experiment tracking
   - Clear template for research notes
   - Organized development logging
